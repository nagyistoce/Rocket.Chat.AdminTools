#Build Rocket.Chat web and android APK

You can use this builder to build Rocket.Chat from source.

All you will need is:

* docker
* git
* a Linux system with at least 4GB (16GB preferred) of RAM and at least 10GB of disk free (SSD preferred)

Change the hostname in scripts/buildit.sh if you want Android APK to use your own Rocket.Chat server.
